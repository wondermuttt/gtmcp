   # For original course scheduling only:
   ./start_server.sh
   ```

### Manual Setup

1. **Create conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create -n gtmcp python=3.11 -y
   conda activate gtmcp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Test the functionality:**
   ```bash
   # Test original course scheduling:
   python test_server.py
   
   # Test expanded multi-system functionality:
   python test_expanded_server.py
   ```

4. **Run unit tests:**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/ -v

- **Server Errors**: Structured error responses for MCP tools

All errors are logged with appropriate severity levels and include helpful context for debugging.

## Note on Data Availability

Georgia Tech may not maintain course details beyond the next semester, even though older semesters appear in the dropdown. Always check that courses are actually available for the requested semester.
